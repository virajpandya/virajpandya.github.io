I am an *observationally-trained* theorist who is broadly interested in galaxy formation in a cosmological context.
I use a combination of analytic theory, numerical experiments in the form of simulations, and observations with both
ground- and space-based telescopes to understand the connection between star formation, black hole formation, galaxy formation 
and large-scale structure formation. Currently, I am a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University. Previously, I was an NSF 
Graduate Research Fellow at UC Santa Cruz and Summer Research Associate at the Flatiron Institute where I completed my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics (2016-2021). 
Prior to that, I was one of the first post-baccalaureate students in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University (2014-2016). 
My pathway into astronomy was non-traditional: I did not know that I wanted to be (or even could be) an astronomer until I was already about to graduate 
from Rutgers University with a bachelorâ€™s degree in economics & mathematics (2013).
